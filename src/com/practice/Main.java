This microservice is responsible for the SW microservice local
TOPP App preview for Java base TOPP App implementations.

This is a 'dumb' microservice in that it won't be generating any data
save for user selection if a user has selected a feature in the preview
window, then that information will be sent to the GUI to reflect that
selection.
